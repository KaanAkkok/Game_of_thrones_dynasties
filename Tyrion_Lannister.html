            <h1>Tyrion Lannister</h1>
            <p>Lord Tyrion Lannister is the youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. A dwarf, he uses his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces. He is the current Lord of Casterly Rock and Hand of the King to Brandon Stark.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Tyrion's mother, Joanna Lannister, died giving birth to him, a tragedy which Tywin and Cersei unfairly blame Tyrion for.
            Tyrion is mocked for being a dwarf, called derisive names such as "Imp" and "Halfman", which he tries to embrace to keep his self esteem up. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a commoner, he'd have been left in the woods to die; luckily, his birthright as a Lannister afforded him significant wealth and power.
            When Tyrion was sixteen, he interrupted the attempted rape of a wheelwright's daughter. While Jaime dispatched the attackers, Tyrion helped the girl, named Tysha, recover. They later became lovers and got married in secret. When Lord Tywin learned what had happened, he payed Tysha, a prostitute, to service every one of his guards while Tyrion watched. Jaime confessed he had orchestrated the attack to help Tyrion lose his virginity.
            While two siblings occupied positions of power, Tyrion was put in charge of the sewers at Casterly Rock when he turned of age.
            Tyrion spent a lot of time at court in King's Landing to avoid his father. He got on well with Jaime, his niece Myrcella and nephew Tommen, but had a colder relationship with Cersei and the psychopathic Joffrey. Tyrion is committed to the good of both his House, and since Cersei married King Robert Baratheon, his family's hold on the throne.</p>
