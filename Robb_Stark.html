            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Robb was the eldest child of Lady Catelyn and Lord Eddard Stark. Robb was born at Riverrun and raised at Winterfell. His father left his mother the morning after their wedding to fight in Robert's Rebellion and did not return until after Robb was born. He had two younger trueborn brothers, Bran and Rickon, and two sisters, Sansa and Arya.
            Jon and Robb. Robb and Jon play as youths. Robb also had a "bastard half-brother", Jon Snow, with whom Robb shared a close relationship. Jon is actually Robb's cousin by blood, as Jon is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. Robb was also close to his father's ward, Theon Greyjoy, whom he counted as his best friend outside of the family. Robb had been trained from childhood to wield a sword and wear armor by Winterfell's master-at-arms Ser Rodrik Cassel, and was highly proficient with both for his young age. He lived at Winterfell with his family.</p>
