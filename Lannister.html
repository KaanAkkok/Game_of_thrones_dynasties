            <h1 style="text-align: center;">House Lannister</h1>
            <p>House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Westeros, one of its richest and most powerful families and one of its oldest dynasties. 
            It was briefly the royal house of the Seven Kingdoms until their defeat in the Last War. The Lannisters rule over the Westerlands. 
            Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. 
            They are the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. As the new royal House, they also ruled directly over the Crownlands 
            from their seat of the Red Keep in King's Landing, the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's Heraldry consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, 
            and their house words are "Hear me roar!", which are rarely mentioned.[1][2] Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, 
            is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.
            The incestuous relationship of Cersei and Jaime had been concealed in a conspiracy. Their son Joffrey Baratheon had claimed the Iron Throne on the premise that 
            he was actually fathered by the late King Robert Baratheon. Lord Tywin was a key supporter of his reign in the War of the Five Kings. The Lannisters continued 
            to hold sway when Tommen Baratheon ascended the throne, with Kevan Lannister as Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm, but lost their hold over Tommen to the 
            Faith of the Seven, and, after destroying the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei took the throne. With the deaths of Cersei and Jaime at the Battle of King's Landing, 
            Tyrion is now the head of House Lannister and given up the crown in favor of an elective monarchy. It currently swears fealty directly to the King of the Andals and 
            the First Men, an office which is currently held by Bran Stark.</p>

            <p>House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is Casterly Rock, 
            a castle on a rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea. It overlooks the thriving city of Lannisport and sits atop the most productive gold mine in the Westerlands. 
            They are the wealthiest family in the realm. ReyneRebellion The red lion of Reyne confronts the golden lion of Lannister Fair-haired, tall and handsome, 
            the modern Lannisters are the blood of Andal adventurers who carved out a mighty kingdom in the western hills and valleys. Through the female line, 
            they boast of descent from Lann the Clever, the legendary trickster of the Age of Heroes who swindled Casterly Rock from House Casterly. 
            They used to rule the Westerlands as the Kings of the Rock before swearing allegiance to House Targaryen. 
            They have since served the Targaryens and now King Robert Baratheon as the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. 
            The gold of Casterly Rock and the Golden Tooth has made them the wealthiest of the Great Houses. House Lannister banner

            Tywin Lannister is the current head of the family. His father Tytos Lannister presided over a period of decline for the house, 
            to the point that their vassals House Reyne rebelled against Lord Tytos. Tywin put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing 
            the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthlessness gave darker meaning to the common phrase "A Lannister always pays his debts" and was immortalized in the song 
            "The Rains of Castamere." Tywin has three children: Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion by his wife Joanna Lannister. 
            Cersei is Queen of Westeros since Tywin arranged for her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, in exchange for his support in Robert's Rebellion. 
            She has a longstanding incestuous relationship with her brother Jaime. The two conspire to conceal their love and have passed their children 
            (Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen) off as being the product of Cersei's marriage.</p>
