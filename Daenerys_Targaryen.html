            <h1>Daenerys Targaryen</h1>
            <p>Queen Daenerys I Targaryen, also known as Daenerys Stormborn, and affectionately known as Dany, was the only daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella, and the younger sister of Rhaegar and Viserys Targaryen.
            Daenerys was initially a timid, obedient youth. After her marriage to Drogo she gathered the confidence of his khalasar. Following his death, she expanded her dominion into Essos, gaining the loyalty of an army of Unsullied and liberating Slaver's Bay from the Ghiscari slave masters.
            During the Last War, Daenerys eventually succumbed to the so-called "Targaryen madness" of her ancestors after a series of personal losses, grief, and betrayal. Razing King's Landing despite its surrender, Daenerys seized power after killing Queen Cersei Lannister, along with countless common folk. Unable to be dissuaded from further destruction, she was assassinated by her nephew Jon Snow to prevent further carnage. She was later succeeded by Bran the Broken, elected by the Great Council of 305 AC.
            She formally styled herself as Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains, though the style was occasionally shortened to Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Daenerys was conceived during Robert's Rebellion. To escape Robert Baratheon's wrath after the Sack of King's Landing, in which Daenerys's father, niece, and nephew were killed, the pregnant Queen Rhaella and young Prince Viserys were sent to the island-castle of Dragonstone, where the queen gave birth to Daenerys. On that night, a severe summer storm raged, giving Daenerys the epithet "Stormborn." Her mother died shortly thereafter, leaving Daenerys and her brother orphans.
            As a baby, she was taken into exile in the Free Cities with her brother by loyal retainers, among them Ser Willem Darry. After years spent fruitlessly trying to raise support to retake the Iron Throne, Viserys and Daenerys were given sanctuary by Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. During this time, Daenerys lived in constant fear of Viserys, who hit her when his temper was risen (in his words, whenever she "woke the dragon"). Living under Viserys's domination left her meek and malleable.</p>
