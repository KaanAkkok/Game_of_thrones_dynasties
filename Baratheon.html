            <p>House Baratheon of Storm's End is a Great House of Westeros that traditionally rules the Stormlands on the eastern coast of Westeros, aptly named for its frequent storms, 
            from their seat of Storm's End. House Baratheon became the royal house of the Seven Kingdoms (as House Baratheon of King's Landing) after Robert Baratheon led a rebellion 
            against the Targaryen dynasty. At the end of the rebellion, Robert ascended the Iron Throne as Robert I and married Cersei Lannister after the death of Lyanna Stark.
            House Baratheon became officially extinct after the deaths of Stannis Baratheon and his family, but was revived when Robert's last known bastard was legitimized 
            by Queen Daenerys Targaryen as Gendry Baratheon. House Baratheon's sigil is a crowned black stag on a gold field and their house words are "Ours is the Fury."</p>
